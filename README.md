# Climate Data Analysis (1901-2020)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes climate data from 1901 to 2020, focusing on annual and seasonal temperature trends. The analysis includes visualizations such as scatter plots, box plots, and bar plots to better understand the data.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
- **YEAR**: The year of observation.
- **ANNUAL**: Annual average temperature (°C).
- **JAN-FEB**: Average temperature for January and February (°C).
- **MAR-MAY**: Average temperature for March to May (°C).
- **JUN-SEP**: Average temperature for June to September (°C).
- **OCT-DEC**: Average temperature for October to December (°C).

### Data Source
The dataset is sourced from [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/).

## Visualizations
1. **Scatter Plot**: Annual temperature trend over the years.
2. **Box Plot**: Distribution of seasonal temperatures.
3. **Line Plot**: Seasonal temperature trends over the years.
4. **Bar Plot**: Average seasonal temperatures.
5. **Bar Plot**: Annual temperature by year.

## Observations
1. **Annual Temperature**:
   - Mean: ~25°C
   - Trend: Slight decrease from 1901 to 2020.
2. **Seasonal Averages**:
   - Hottest Season: **JUN-SEP** (Monsoon/Summer)
   - Coolest Season: **JAN-FEB** (Winter)
3. **Temperature Trend**:
   - Overall, the annual temperature shows a decreasing trend.

## Files
- **Notebook**: Contains the Python code for data analysis and visualization.
- **Plots**: Generated visualizations saved as `climate_analysis_plots.png`.

## How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib pandas numpy
   ```
2. Run the notebook to generate the plots and analysis.
